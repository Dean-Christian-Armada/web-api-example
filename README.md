Hi!,

This is an example of a web api.

Please excuse my codes as it is not optimized and can even be considered spaghetti. 

The goal here is a demonstration for those who want to learn web api in its most basic idea and explanation.

Steps:

1.) In your terminal type https://github.com/django/django.git

2.) Activate your virtual environment(not really necessary)

3.) pip install -r requirements.txt

4.) cd/web-api-example

5.) python manage.py runserver

I suggest you learn more with the basics:
AngularJS - http://www.w3schools.com/angular/
Django - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/
Django Rest Framework - http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/

Enjoy!
